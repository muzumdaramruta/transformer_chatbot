# Transformer-Based Chat-Bot

## Overview
This project implements a Transformer-based chatbot using PyTorch. The notebook (`transformer.ipynb`) contains detailed steps for building, training, and evaluating a neural network model for conversational AI. Transformers are widely regarded for their effectiveness in handling sequence-to-sequence tasks such as natural language processing and machine translation.


## Contents of the Notebook

### 1. **Introduction**
- **Markdown**: Brief introduction to the Transformer architecture and its applications in chatbots.
- **Objective**: Build and train a chatbot using the Transformer model with PyTorch.

### 2. **Setup and Initialization**
- **Dependencies**: Import required libraries.
  ```python
  import warnings
  warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
  ```
- Suppresses unnecessary warnings to streamline the workflow.

### 3. **Dataset Preparation**
- **Goal**: Load and preprocess the dataset for training the chatbot.
- **Steps**:
    - Data loading: Import raw conversational data.
    - Tokenization: Break down text into manageable tokens.
    - Vocabulary creation: Map tokens to unique indices.
    - Padding: Normalize input lengths for batch processing.

### 4. **Model Definition**
#### Transformer Architecture
The Transformer model is a neural network architecture designed to process sequences. Unlike traditional RNNs, it relies on the self-attention mechanism to process input tokens in parallel, making it highly efficient for large datasets. Key components include:

1. **Encoder**:
    - Accepts input sequences and processes them into a series of feature-rich representations.
    - Uses self-attention to focus on important tokens in the sequence.
    - Includes position embeddings to retain the order of tokens.

2. **Decoder**:
    - Receives encoded input and generates output sequences step by step.
    - Uses masked self-attention to ensure predictions are based on prior outputs only.
    - Integrates encoder-decoder attention to align generated tokens with input tokens.

3. **Attention Mechanism**:
    - Captures relationships between words, regardless of their positions in the sequence.
    - Computes attention weights to focus on relevant words dynamically.

#### Code Structure
- **Custom Transformer Implementation**:
  ```python
  class TransformerModel(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim, ...):
          super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
          # Define embedding layers, encoder, decoder, and linear projections
  ```
    - **Embedding Layers**: Convert tokens into dense vectors.
    - **Multi-Head Attention**: Enables the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously.
    - **Feedforward Networks**: Adds depth and non-linearity to the model.
    - **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training by normalizing intermediate outputs.

- **Positional Encoding**:
    - Adds information about the token order.
  ```python
  def positional_encoding(seq_len, dim):
      # Generates sinusoidal positional encodings
  ```

- **Forward Pass**:
    - Integrates all components to process input and generate output.

### 5. **Training Loop**
- **Objective**: Train the Transformer model.
- **Steps**:
    - Define loss function: Cross-entropy loss for sequence modeling.
    - Optimizer: Adam optimizer for weight updates.
    - Epochs: Iterate over the dataset for multiple passes.
    - Save the best-performing model.

### 6. **Evaluation**
- **Metrics**: Assess the chatbotâ€™s performance using BLEU scores or accuracy.
- **Inference**: Test the chatbot with example conversations.

### 7. **Visualization**
- Plots training and validation loss curves.
  ```python
  plt.plot(train_losses, label='Train Loss')
  plt.plot(val_losses, label='Validation Loss')
  plt.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

### 8. **Saving and Loading Models**
- **Purpose**: Save trained weights for future use.
- **Commands**:
  ```python
  torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_weights.pth')
  ```
